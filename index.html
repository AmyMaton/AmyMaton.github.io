										<p>So much like our subject to the right I spam a keyboard (different kind however) and things just seem to happen. But when other people spam the keyboard not as much good stuff happens so that’s why you employ me not them. Seriosuly however I do study video game programming at Staffordshire university, I am currently in my second year and have devloped projects such as recreating mario and  pacman.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Days Old</h3>
											<p>Days Old was a passion project I worked on throughout 2019. I focused on using UE4 and blueprints, my goal was to publish the game eventually but due to the breakdown of a relationship and there involvement in the project that never came to be. You can still download the first versions of the game online which I think shows a good indication of what could have been.</p>
											<h3 class="major">Focus:</h3>
											<p>- Unreal Engine 4 (mainly Blueprints)</p>
											<p>- PhotoShop (Visuals)</p>

											<p>Using S2D and some insturctions to make a pacman-like game I have been creating a doomskulle inspired game. Now I havent had time to implement the full game and probably won't by the deadline but it has been a fun introduction to C++.</p>

									<h3 class="major">HOW TO BE A TRYHARD SCOUT IN TF2!!!</h3>
									<p>In this video I took a look at the stereotypes surronding the scout in TeamFortress2. Im proud of this video becasuse it has a lot of moving parts, from my 3D renders in Source Film Maker to my countless created images in Photoshop. I think in total this video has around 10 to 15 hours of production value. Although the views didn't paticularily pull through Its still one of my favorites.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Different... (TF2 IN SLOW MOTION 300FPS ULTRA)</h3>
									<p>This video was intersting for me, I wanted to make somthing more artsy so experimented with recording at a really high framerate. Unfortunatly I got some flack in real life for being "edgey" but I like how it turned out. </p>
