									<h2 class="major">Programming</h2>
									<p>This summer I am graduting for Staffordshire University with a degree in computer games programming, prior to my degree I recieved a diploma in video game design and development from SGS college where I focused on visual scripting in Unreal. I have participated in many projects from creating a local multiplayer social deception game, a game engine in a team project and a research project into AI using Magic! The Gathering as a testing ground.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Speedrunning </h2>
									<p>Since getting into gaming being at the highest level has always been an interest of mine. It started off with playing TeamFortress 2 at a competetive level in both highlander and 5s, running platoons of 120 people in Planetside 2 but eventually finding my feet in speedrunning. Since then I have held world records in both Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2017), Laraan and Planetside 2, currently I hold multiple individual level world record in Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2017) and plan on going for the any% world record again somtime soon.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Magic! The Gathering</h2>
									<p>Since starting playing Magic! The Gathering in 2017 it has been a huge part of my life. I have played pretty consistently since mainly in draft formats for the first few years but in my final year of university I found my way into competetive commander known as CEDH. I have since helped develop 2 top tier decks. A mono red Magda Brazem Outlaw deck and a Gale Waterdeep Prodigy plus Scion of Halaster deck, both have allowed me to become consitenctly top 3 at my every commander tourament I have been too. Now coming to finish university I plan on expanding into modern and seeing where my future of Magic! is. </p>

										<p>Days Old was a passion project I worked on throughout 2019. I focused on using UE4 and blueprints, my goal was to publish the game eventually but due to the breakdown of a relationship and there involvement in the project that never came to be. You can still download the first versions of the game online which I think shows a good indication of what could have been.</p>

									<h3 class="major">HOW TO BE A TRYHARD SCOUT IN TF2!!!</h3>
									<p>In this video I took a look at the stereotypes surronding the scout in TeamFortress2. Im proud of this video becasuse it has a lot of moving parts, from my 3D renders in Source Film Maker to my countless created images in Photoshop. I think in total this video has around 10 to 15 hours of production value. Although the views didn't paticularily pull through Its still one of my favorites.</p>

									<p>This video was intersting for me, I wanted to make somthing more artsy so experimented with recording at a really high framerate. Unfortunatly I got some flack in real life for being "edgey" but I like how it turned out. </p>
